# Files

* Create a new Python file in this folder called **amazon.py**.

* Write code to read the content of the text file ‘input.txt’. For each line in ‘input.txt’, write a new line in the new text file ‘output.txt’ that computes the answer to some operation on a list of numbers.

* If the ‘input.txt’ has the following: 
  * Min: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6
  * Max: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6 
  * Avg: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6

* Your program should generate ‘output.txt’ as follows:
  * The min of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 1. 
  * The max of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 6. 
  * The avg of [1, 2, 3, 5, 6] is 3.4.

* Assume that the only operations given in the input file are min, max and avg, and that the operation is always followed by a list of comma separated integers.
